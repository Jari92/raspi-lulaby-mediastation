# raspi-lulaby-mediastation
This code uses a bash script to start media files with a half random shutdown sleeptimer (e.g. for bedtime story, lulaby) with auto save. The last played song will be the starting point at the next boot. Tested on headless Rapsberry Pi 3 B+ running Raspbian with speakers over jack output.
